Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.

Music is an inherently capitalised product - though considered a creative medium, the commodification of music has created an inaccessible and elitist culture by which only those with the financial means can access the truest, most valuable forms of music.

#### For example, streaming.

One can only access the 40 million plus songs on spotify by paying their fee of *just £9.99* every month to access these audio recordings. The deeper the consideration required, the greated the financial strain - Beyonce's album 'Lemonade' originally debuted on her husband Jay Z's platform, Tidal - ringing in at yet another £9.99. 

Of course, its not just the audio content that musicking peoples search for. We also seek the notations and scores of europe and america's greatest historic composers. Of course, the simplest sheet music can easily be found for free, but the harder it gets and the more the individual progresses, the more expensive, and difficult to find, the resources become.

#### So where do we stand when it comes to the public domain? Don't sites like IMSLP combat this issue?

Absolutely; IMSLP is the public battle-bot against the privitisation of culture. It still stands as one of the most difficult to use, and most essential sites for musicians, composers, analysist, curators, critics, and scholars.

#### And for my next trick I will exemplify all of these points through a _study on the music of Schubert_

Schubert (1797-1828), a 19th century romantic composer, is of course immortalised through western notation and sheet music - a very simple yet effective way of communicating sound without actually having to make any. In the 21st century we take that for granted - many musicians no longer value the skill of reading notated music, however at the time Schubert was writing the phonography cylinder hadn't been invented, let alone the LP, CD, or any semblance of digitisation. 

So historically, notation was the only way to communicate your compositions without being in the room. It took away the _need_ for composers to also fill the shoes of a director, conductor, and performer.  Now these scores hold such lesser value - the comtemporary listener can find at least 5 different excellent and professional performances of _"Erlkönig"_ on the first page of google, along with at least 5 sites offering you the sheet music on at least 5 different instruments, adapted by at least 5 more composers making his works accessible to all musicking individuals.

#### ... so the data sets?

From the view of an analytics student, his works are often curated as notational texts - often grouping several works together using opus numbers or similar, or as audio - in album or compliation formats - very different to their intended use. Yet this is the way his works are accessed most. 

Notation to sound, not notation OR sound.
