#Week One

Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.

Music is an inherently capitalised product - though considered a creative medium, the commodification of music has created an inaccessible and elitist culture by which only those with the finances can access the truest forms of music.

#### For example, streaming.

One can only access the 40 million plus songs on spotify by paying their fee of *just Â£9.99* every month to access these audio recordings. The deeper the consideration required, the greated the financial strain. The simplest sheet music can easily be found for free, but the harder it gets and the more the individual progresses, the more expensive and difficult to find the resources become.
